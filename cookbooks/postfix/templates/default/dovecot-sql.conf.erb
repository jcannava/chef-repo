# Database driver: mysql, pgsql, sqlite
driver = mysql

# Examples:
#   connect = host=192.168.1.1 dbname=users
#   connect = host=sql.example.com dbname=virtual user=virtual password=blarg
#   connect = /etc/dovecot/authdb.sqlite
connect = host=<%= @db_host %> dbname=<%= @db_name %> user=<%= @mail_user %> password=<%= @mail_password %>

# Example:
#   password_query = SELECT password FROM users WHERE userid = '%n' AND domain = '%d'
#   password_query = SELECT pw AS password FROM users WHERE userid = '%u' AND active = 'Y'
#
# password_query = SELECT email as user, password FROM users WHERE email = '%u'
# password_query = SELECT concat(userid, '@', domain) AS user, password FROM users WHERE userid='%n' AND domain='%d'
# password_query = SELECT email as user, password FROM users WHERE email='%u'
password_query = SELECT NULL AS password, email AS user, 1010 as uid, 1011 as gid, mail FROM users WHERE email='%u' AND password=password('%w')

# Query to retrieve the user information.
# Examples
#   user_query = SELECT home, uid, gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%n' AND domain = '%d'
#   user_query = SELECT dir AS home, user AS uid, group AS gid FROM users where userid = '%u'
#   user_query = SELECT home, 501 AS uid, 501 AS gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
#
#user_query = SELECT home, uid, gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
user_query = SELECT 1010 AS uid, 1011 AS gid, mail FROM users WHERE email='%u'

# If you wish to avoid two SQL lookups (passdb + userdb), you can use
# userdb prefetch instead of userdb sql in dovecot.conf. In that case you'll
# also have to return userdb fields in password_query prefixed with "userdb_"
# string. For example:
#password_query = SELECT userid as user, password, home as userdb_home, uid as userdb_uid, gid as userdb_gid FROM users WHERE userid = '%u'
